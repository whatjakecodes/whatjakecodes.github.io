# Pair Programming in 2021

## Intro

For many practitioners in the 2021 work-from-home world, pair programming has been forced into a big change for over a year now:
remote-only in timezone-distributed teams.

While there are teams that jumped into remote-only, timezone-distributed pair programming work previously, the COVID-19 pandemic
has forced many co-located practitioners into new situations:

* How do I manage my ever-present work-from-home life and pair all day long?
* How do I spend my time solo if my pair's working hours have not begun?
* How do I spend my time solo if my pair's working hours just concluded?
* How should my team's co-located developers best communicate with the remote-only developers?

These are on top of existing scenarios that weren't always easy when co-located:
* How do I effectively work with more-experienced/less-experienced developers?
* How does my team rotate pairs effectively to spread knowledge?

I've been working on remote-only, timezone-distributed teams during the past year and a half, and a discussion on these topics is valuable.
Finding different pairing strategies to deploy in these new, different situations will make pairing more effective and less cumbersome.

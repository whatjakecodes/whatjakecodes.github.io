## Intro

I am seeing a change in the sorts of conflict I experience while pair programming in the remote, pandemic-suffering, work-from-home world. 
Conflict happens regularly when groups of individuals work together (even before the pandemic), 
and I have been thinking how a fear of conflict in the past has prevented better outcomes for me and my teams.
Would people who embrace conflict do better? That's a question I invite you to think about with me. 

I see pair programming as a tool to navigate conflict healthily with my team members. 
If conflict isn't explored well, then we feel more disconnected from our teams, and we less effectively deliver.
Unexplored conflict festers. And conflict doesn't have to be resolved for us to benefit from it.

## What is conflict?
Conflict is not just about violence. 
Conflict is any time one feels or thinks something like "this is wrong" or "this could be better".
Disagreements between individuals are traditional interpersonal conflicts.
Not knowing how to do something, like test-driven development or even basic arithmetic, is a sort of internal knowledge conflict.
How we respond to conflict determines what kind of outcomes we get.

## Conflict Literacy vs. Conflict Resolution

"Conflict literacy" is a new-to-me phrase I stumbled upon recently from Bob Hall's work.

Bob Hall describes how oftentimes, we want to "resolve" conflict when we detect it.
Usually, as fast and efficiently as possible.
Conflicts are simply problems to be solved.

But, conflict arises before us in many forms and can be very complex.
Sometimes the true "cause" of a conflict is deep and difficult to detect.
I've been in situations where I thought I had resolved a conflict, but later realized I had not.
To believe "I alone can fix it" is hubris.

Conflict is best used as an opportunity to explore and learn about oneself and others, not as an opportunity resolve or win something.

## How might we approach conflict?
Here are some ways I might approach two conflicts.

### Scenario 1: I don't agree with my team member's decision
If I see a team member make a decision I don't agree with, I face a conflict.
I want to change course and make the correct decision, so I need to interact with that team member.

I might tell my team member they're wrong and here's the right way.
Perhaps they quickly submit to me and the team goes along with my decision.

Or, I might go explore and ask them about their thinking.
By asking questions, I might learn something I didn't realize before. 
Perhaps even I start to feel my idea was wrong. Or a third idea arises during the conversation, and we seize it. 

### Scenario 2: I don't understand a concept or how to use it
If I don't understand how to do something, I face an internal conflict.
I want the new knowledge or skill, but I lack something foundational to really access it.

I might become frustrated and give up on acquiring that understanding of that concept.
Or, I might go explore and find the missing pieces. 
Perhaps I ask a colleague, and they help me re-frame my perspective.


## Common Pair Programmer Conflicts

What kind of conflicts has the pair programming tool helped us manage?

Conflicts that pairing helps us navigate:
* navigating differences in knowledge (of a system, language, tool)
* navigating differences in opinions (of how to implement, approach, discuss)
* improving engineering team camaraderie 
* reducing engineer isolation

Conflicts experienced during pairing:
* facilitating our pair's learning
* facilitating our own learning
* rotating pairs within a team
* working with more-or-less-experienced persons

## Remote Pair Programming Conflicts

Remote-first pairing has surfaced other kinds of conflict:

* my other-timezone pair is unavailable. What should I work on?
* my other-timezone pair is unavailable, and I don't know how to work on our assigned feature. What do I do?
* my other-timezone pair made code changes without me that I wouldn't recommend. How do I handle this?
* the network is lagging. How do me and my pair exchange keyboard/mouse control?
* my work-frome-home environment has distractions from work
* some of my team is remote, and some is co-located. How do we collaborate as one team? 

## Experiments in Remote Pair Programming

Here are summaries of remote pair programming experiments I've tried or discussed with other people.
This isn't an exhaustive list.

### Remote Pairing retro
A retro focused on pairing should help uncover what a team's unique challenges or conflicts.
At the beginning, establish the goal to improve the remote pairing process.
Throughout the retro, everyone should be looking for ideas on specific experiments.

### Stand-down channel
At the end of one's work day, write a brief summary of where one left off on work. When the

### Async pairing

This a broad strategy about embracing the fact that engineers want to maximize pairing, but are working at different hours of the day.
Usually because of timezone differences, but potentially because of other workday flexibility reasons, too.
This is a significant change for pair programmers who used to work a full 8 hours a day, co-located with their pairs in the same room.
Async pair requires tactical context hand-offs as the members of a pair cycle in and out of their workday.

Let's say there's an east coast and west coast engineer in a pair. 
This means there's a 3 hour difference, and the two persons 8-hour workday will include a 5-hour overlap for pairing.
There may be 1-2 hours of time reserved within that 5-hours for team meetings, so this leaves about 3-4 hours for pairing per day.

### Async pair task types

At the beginning of a new feature, a pair might breakdown the development work into tasks. 
Which tasks does the pair want to pair on (pair-tasks)?
Which tasks are OK to solo on (solo-tasks), and do an async context-share on (via stand-down channel or direct-message?

Successful async pairing will differ depending on the kind of pair.
Two senior engineers? One junior and one senior? Two juniors?
Recognizing this should help inform what approach to take.

Solo Tasks
* Admin time
* Write documentation
* Work on a learning course

Senior Engineer Solo Tasks
* research solutions for the tricky component of a feature
* prepare a learning mini-workshop
* collect resources/articles for junior to review and discuss later
* write code for the agreed-upon solo-tasks
* research options for pair-tasks

Junior Engineer Solo Tasks
* attempt to solve either solo-tasks or pair-tasks (as a learning opportunity)
* document questions to ask (for when pairing resumes)
* practice techniques

If both are senior engineers, the most troubling conflict probably involves the implementation choices made when the other person is offline.


## Call to Action: more experimentation on conflict-exploration via pair programming

What other kinds of conflict have you seen arise in our pandemic, remote, work-from-home world?

How have you navigated these conflicts? 
What ideas do you have for better conflict literacy in the pair programming space?
What experiments have you tried or want to try?

Using appropriate pairing strategies and techniques in these new, different situations should contribute to the team's success.
